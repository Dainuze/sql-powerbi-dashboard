- **Profitability:** Company maintains good profitability with overall sales margin of **51.91%**.
- **Customer demographics:** Most purchases come from the **55+** age group, followed by customers **under 25**. There are slightly more male buyers than female.
- ‚ùóüö® **Critical Insight:** **Cancelled orders** account for ~15% of all orders - this represents a **significant revenue loss**. It's essential to investigate the causes and take action.  
- **Returned orders** make up ~10% of all orders - a **normal trend in fashion e-commerce**, as customers can't try items before buying.
- **Geographical trends:** China and United States lead in customer orders and sales volumes
- **Traffic sources performance:** Search is the **top revenue driver**, significantly outperforming other channels with **$2.490K** in total sales.
